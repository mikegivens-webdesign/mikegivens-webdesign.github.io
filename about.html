        <p>What is Alien Cow Games? <br>
            When I was in the fourth grade, my friend and I started drawing comic books,
            (largely inspired by captain underpants). The comics were about a mutant human sized marshmellow
            and an alien cow.
            As a child, I found unadulterated joy in making these ridiculous comics.
            We would make copies and hand them out to classmates. Truthfully, I don't even remember if kids liked them, or
            if they just thought we were weird, but the point is it was fun.
            The seal on the back of every comic was "Alien Cow Comics".
            <br> <br>
            sidenote - I had a friend who used to draw pictures of vampires and stick them in her neighbors mailbox to annoy him.
            What a terrifically pointless and awesome thing to do...
            <br> <br>
            When I decided to make my first game in javascript, I rediscovered this joy.
            I drew characters and worlds in my sketchbook, I starting learning to code,
            and before I knew it months had gone by,
            and I had hardly noticed because I was having fun.
            Alien Cow Games is the 10 year old in me having fun,
            and I hope it brings out the 10 year old in you.
