            <p>1. Comment on others posts<br>
            Engaging with similar brands on social media can boost your 
            visibility by tapping into overlapping audiences, increasing the likelihood of shares, mentions, 
            and collaborations. It signals relevance within your niche, encourages algorithmic 
            favor by generating interaction, and helps build community credibility and trust through association.
            </p>
            <p>2. Post on a daily basis <br>
                Research shows that posting on a daily basis increases how often
                your content is suggested in algorithms. Pages who post daily
                have more engagement and see more growth over time.

            <p>3. Reply to comments on your posts.<br>
            Not only do replies draw attention to your business, but they
            create a sense of community with the viewers, who are likely to come back.
            Additionally replying and liking comments increases your viewership
            by showing your profile to followers of the commenter.

            <p>4. Interactive content<br>
            On many platforms, such as instagram,
            it is possible to allow viewers to vote, or share their opinions.
            These posts increase viewer engagement by making them feel
            like part of a community.
            </p>
            <p>5. Video shorts <br>
                Video shorts are the most popular form of media consumption
                right now. This means that if you are making short videos,
                on Tiktok, Youtube, Facebook, or all, you are a step ahead
                of other businesses in exposure, especially if you make videos concerning
                your local area.
