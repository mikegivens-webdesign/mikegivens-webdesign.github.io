            <p>How do you find authenticity?<br>
            To me, authenticity comes from art, and art comes from play. The reason that art is
            so valuable is because it reminds you to be playful.
            <br><br>My sister, she likes to paint pictures of animals smoking cigarettes. Every time she sends me a new picture,
            I am overjoyed by the sheer ridiculousness of it. What could be more authentically human than that?
            Don't know how to be yourself? Try being silly. Try being playful.
            </p>
            <p>Finding joy in your job<br>
                How do you find joy at work? This one is hard. Some of the best advice
                I've heard on the subject is "treat your passions like your job, and 
                your job like your side hustle".
                If you seek meaning in a dead-end job, you will be miserable.
                Don't invest your future in a corporations dream. Invest in your own dreams, and in the meantime,
                try to remain positive. And when you're having a bad day, just think of how when you get home,
                your art is there waiting for you.

            <p>How do I create 'good' art?<br>
            There is only one way to do such a thing, and that is to have fun.
            If you have fun making it, surely someone will have engaging with it!
            As Picasso is quoted as saying, "It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child".

            <p>"But I'm not talented"<br>
            Talent isn't real. Draw the shittiest unicorn you possibly can.<br>
            Give him vampire fangs. Make a three frame walk cycle.<br>
            Make a game where you suck color from objects to create rainbows.<br>
            Draw the background with pastels and scan it to your computer.<br>
            Make a soundtrack on free software like bandlab.<br>
            Make sound effects by rolling marbles, squeezing ketchup bottles, wobbling sheet metal.<br>
            Now if that doesn't at least sound like fun, I don't know what is!<br>
            And how do we make good art? By having fun!
